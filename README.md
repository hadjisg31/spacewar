This is my take on simple galaga shooting archade game.  I've done this while studying and reviewing java programming and oop.

Game logic was forked from https://github.com/jaykru/tinygalaga. 

I've refactored and code and made it more OOP-based.  I've also extended the features adding game lives, and more enemy objects.


I'm planning to put some more action into the game, but due to priorities I will be less focusing on this for now
